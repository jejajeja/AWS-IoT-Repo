# AWS-IoT
All credentials removed for security reason, so project cannot be tested without it. 
I can provide keys and certificate of virtual device for testing purposes.

prerequisites for deploying the same resources:
IAM user with admin permissions
SAM CLI istalled
nodeJS 12.x installed

template.yaml --> main file used for generating all resources used in demo project, by cloudformation service (resource as code) and AWS SAM (Serverless app model)
packaged.yaml --> file generated after deploying resources
